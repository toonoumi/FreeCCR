  This file is the GitHub release body, read at the TAGGED commit by all three
  jobs in .github/workflows/release.yml. Before tagging a release, REPLACE the
  "What's New" section with ONLY that release's changes (git history keeps the
  old ones) — the check-notes job fails the tag build unless this file mentions

## What's New

**FreeCCR 1.3.0** — a reversal-film look, and faster mode switching.

- **White sprocket holes / clear film (reversal look).** A new Settings toggle paints the sprocket holes and clear film border white instead of black after conversion — matching how reversal (slide) film actually looks when scanned. Available for any image with a Black Point set; on for preview, zoom, and export alike.
- **Keyboard shortcuts for Crop, Dust Removal, and White Balance.** Press **C** to toggle Crop, **D** to toggle Dust Removal, and **W** to toggle the White Balance eyedropper — no more reaching for the mouse to switch modes. The WB eyedropper button also now toggles off on a second click, matching the new hotkey.

## Install

### Windows
Download the installer (`FreeCCR_Install_*.exe`) from the **Assets** below and run it.

### macOS (Apple Silicon)
Download `FreeCCR_macOS_*.zip` from the **Assets**, unzip it, and move `FreeCCR.app` into your **Applications** folder.

⚠️ **macOS may say the app is "damaged and can't be opened" — it isn't.** FreeCCR isn't notarized by Apple, so Gatekeeper blocks unsigned downloads on first launch. Clear the quarantine flag once by running this in **Terminal**:

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/FreeCCR.app
```

Then open the app normally.

*Alternative:* right-click the app → **Open** → **Open**. On macOS Sequoia (15), if no "Open" button appears, use the Terminal command above, or go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**.

### Linux (x86_64)
**AppImage (recommended):** download `FreeCCR_Linux_*-x86_64.AppImage` from the **Assets**, make it executable, and run it:

```
chmod +x FreeCCR_Linux_*-x86_64.AppImage
./FreeCCR_Linux_*-x86_64.AppImage
```

**Portable folder:** download `FreeCCR_Linux_*-x86_64.tar.gz`, extract it anywhere, and run `FreeCCR/FreeCCR`. Fully self-contained — no Python or packages to install.

Built on Ubuntu 22.04, so it runs on any x86_64 distro with glibc 2.35 or newer: Ubuntu 22.04+, Linux Mint 21+, Debian 12+, Fedora 36+, openSUSE, Arch, etc.
